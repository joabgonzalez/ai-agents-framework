# Skill Creation

## Overview

Create standards-compliant skills from simple single-file to complex multi-reference architectures. Covers directory setup, frontmatter requirements, content structure, inline examples, delegation patterns, and synchronization.

## Objective

Enable creation of skills at ANY complexity level (simple <15 patterns to complex 40+) that are discoverable, reusable, token-efficient, and follow project conventions. Each skill must have unique responsibility and delegate appropriately to conventions/a11y.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Creating new skill from scratch
- Pattern is used repeatedly and AI needs guidance
- Project conventions differ from generic best practices
- Complex workflows need structured instructions
- Technology has multiple sub-topics requiring organization

Don't create when:

- Documentation already exists (create reference instead)
- Pattern is trivial or self-explanatory
- It's a one-off task

---

## Quick Reference

| Complexity | Indicators                 | Structure                        | Read                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | <15 patterns, single topic | SKILL.md only                    | This file                                                               |
| Medium     | 15-40 patterns, 2-3 topics | SKILL.md + assets/               | [structure.md](references/structure.md)                                 |
| Complex    | 40+ patterns, 4+ topics    | SKILL.md + assets/ + references/ | ✅ **MUST invoke** [reference-creation](../reference-creation/SKILL.md) |

**CRITICAL**: For complex skills (40+ patterns), **MUST invoke** [reference-creation](../reference-creation/SKILL.md) skill for creating references/ directory.

---

## Critical Patterns

### ✅ REQUIRED [CRITICAL]: Use Template for Consistency

```bash
cp skills/skill-creation/assets/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
# Fill placeholders: {skill-name}, {description}, {Trigger}, etc.
```

### ✅ REQUIRED [CRITICAL]: Include Trigger in Description

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT
description: TypeScript strict patterns. Trigger: When implementing TypeScript in .ts/.tsx files.

# ❌ WRONG: Missing Trigger
description: TypeScript strict patterns.
```

**See** [frontmatter.md](references/frontmatter.md) for complete frontmatter guide.

### ✅ REQUIRED [CRITICAL]: Add Decision Tree

Every skill MUST include Decision Tree for AI guidance.

```markdown
## Decision Tree
```

Condition? → Action
Otherwise → Default

```

```

### ✅ REQUIRED [CRITICAL]: Include Inline Examples

Place focused example (<15 lines) immediately after each Critical Pattern.

````markdown
### ✅ REQUIRED: Hook Dependencies

Always include dependencies.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]);
```
````

```

**See** [content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md) for writing patterns and examples.

### ✅ REQUIRED: Create References for Complex Skills

**When skill has 40+ patterns or 4+ natural sub-topics**, use `references/` directory.

```

skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md (300 lines max)
└── references/
├── {sub-topic-1}.md
├── {sub-topic-2}.md
└── {sub-topic-3}.md

````

**For complex skills (40+ patterns):** Invoke [reference-creation](../reference-creation/SKILL.md) skill.

### ✅ REQUIRED: Delegate to General Skills

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT: Delegate to conventions
skills:
  - conventions
  - a11y

## Conventions
Refer to conventions for:
- Naming patterns

### Skill-Specific
- TypeScript strict mode required
````

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG: Duplicating conventions content
## Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables...
```

### ✅ REQUIRED: Token Efficiency

- Omit empty frontmatter arrays/objects
- Description under 150 characters
- Remove filler words ("comprehensive", "detailed")
- Every word adds unique value

**For skills with 40+ patterns: MUST read** [token-efficiency.md](references/token-efficiency.md) for compression strategies and organization techniques.

**For simpler skills: CHECK** [token-efficiency.md](references/token-efficiency.md) for optional optimization techniques.

### ✅ REQUIRED: Validate Structure

Before finalizing:

```bash
# Validate frontmatter
cat SKILL.md | yq eval '.frontmatter' -

# Validate against schema
yq eval-o=json SKILL.md | \
  yq eval-all '.' skills/skill-creation/assets/frontmatter-schema.json -
```

**See** [validation.md](references/validation.md) for complete checklist.

### ❌ NEVER: Duplicate Conventions

Don't rewrite rules that exist in conventions or a11y. Delegate first, then add skill-specific rules.

---

## Decision Tree

```
How many patterns?
  → <15 patterns? → Simple (SKILL.md only)
  → 15-40 patterns? → Medium (consider assets/ if templates needed)
  → 40+ patterns? → Complex (references/ required, MUST invoke reference-creation skill)

Has 2+ natural sub-topics? → Use references/ (even if <40 patterns)
SKILL.md will exceed 300 lines? → Use references/

Need templates/schemas? → Create assets/ directory
Need validation schema? → Add to assets/, reference in frontmatter

Generic rules? → Delegate to conventions
Accessibility rules? → Delegate to a11y

After creation? → Run skill-sync or make sync to propagate
```

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Complexity

| Patterns | Sub-Topics | Structure                        | Reference                                                               |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <15      | 1          | SKILL.md only                    | This file                                                               |
| 15-40    | 2-3        | SKILL.md + assets/               | [structure.md](references/structure.md)                                 |
| 40+      | 4+         | SKILL.md + assets/ + references/ | ✅ **MUST invoke** [reference-creation](../reference-creation/SKILL.md) |

### Step 2: Create Structure

```bash
# Simple
mkdir skills/{skill-name}
cp skills/skill-creation/assets/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md

# Medium
mkdir -p skills/{skill-name}/assets

# Complex (MUST read references-overview.md first)
mkdir -p skills/{skill-name}/{assets,references}
```

### Step 3: Fill Template

- Copy SKILL-TEMPLATE.md to new directory
- Replace all placeholders
- Add frontmatter (name, description with Trigger, skills, dependencies)
- Fill required sections (Overview, Objective, When to Use, Critical Patterns, Decision Tree, Conventions, Example, Edge Cases)

**See** [frontmatter.md](references/frontmatter.md) for frontmatter requirements.

### Step 4: Add Inline Examples

Place example (<15 lines) after each Critical Pattern.

**See** [content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md) for example patterns.

### Step 5: Add Decision Tree

Use condition→action format.

```
Condition? → Action
Otherwise → Default
```

### Step 6: Delegate to Conventions

Before adding rules, check if conventions/a11y covers them. Delegate first.

### Step 7: Validate

- Use Compliance Checklist (below)
- Validate frontmatter against schema
- Check all sections present
- Verify token efficiency

**See** [validation.md](references/validation.md) for complete validation guide.

### Step 8: Sync

```bash
make sync
# or
npm run sync
```

---

## Conventions

Refer to [conventions](../conventions/SKILL.md) for:

- Naming patterns
- Code organization
- Documentation standards

Refer to [a11y](../a11y/SKILL.md) for:

- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes

### Skill-Creation-Specific

- Use lowercase-with-hyphens for directory/file names
- Include Trigger clause in description
- Add Decision Tree to every skill
- Inline examples under 15 lines
- Complex skills (40+): Use references/
- SKILL.md max 300 lines (complex skills)
- Omit empty frontmatter arrays/objects

---

## Example

See [examples.md](references/examples.md) for complete examples:

- Simple skill (Prettier, <15 patterns)
- Medium skill (Formik, 15-40 patterns)
- Complex skill (React, 40+ patterns with references/)

---

## Edge Cases

### Migrating Existing Skill to Complex

If skill grows beyond 40 patterns:

1. Read [references-overview.md](references/references-overview.md)
2. Identify natural sub-topics
3. Create references/ directory
4. Follow [references-implementation.md](references/references-implementation.md)
5. Keep top 10-15 patterns in SKILL.md
6. Link to references throughout

### Version-Specific Patterns

For breaking changes across versions:

```
references/
├── current.md (v3)
├── legacy.md (v2)
└── migration.md
```

### Transversal Topics

Topics that apply across skill (like token-efficiency in skill-creation):

- Create separate reference file
- Link from multiple Critical Patterns
- Mark as "transversal" in overview

---

## Self-Check Protocol

Before creating skill, verify:

### Planning

- [ ] I identified skill complexity (simple/medium/complex)
- [ ] I read this SKILL.md completely
- [ ] If complex (40+ patterns), I will invoke [reference-creation](../reference-creation/SKILL.md) skill
- [ ] I understand references/ creation is delegated to reference-creation skill
- [ ] I checked if conventions/a11y already covers topic

### Structure

- [ ] I used SKILL-TEMPLATE.md as starting point
- [ ] Directory name is lowercase-with-hyphens
- [ ] Created assets/ if templates/schemas needed
- [ ] Created references/ if 40+ patterns or 4+ sub-topics

### Content

- [ ] Frontmatter includes required fields (name, description with Trigger)
- [ ] Empty frontmatter arrays/objects omitted
- [ ] All sections present (Overview, Objective, When to Use, Critical Patterns, Decision Tree, Conventions, Example, Edge Cases)
- [ ] Each Critical Pattern has inline example (<15 lines)
- [ ] Decision Tree uses condition→action format
- [ ] Delegated to conventions/a11y before adding rules
- [ ] Token-efficient (no filler, every word adds value)

### Validation

- [ ] SKILL.md under 300 lines (complex skills)
- [ ] Frontmatter validates against schema
- [ ] All referenced skills exist
- [ ] Compliance Checklist completed (see below)

**Confidence Check:**

1. Can AI create skill in ANY topic using this guide?
2. Are conditions clear when to read each reference?
3. Is SKILL.md focused (top patterns only for complex)?

If NO to any: Re-read relevant sections.
